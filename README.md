A simple website to facilitate the use of PGP. Although the use of PGP is quite widespread
i made this tool in order to provide a straightforward interface that can provide
encryption and decryption of PGP messages and the generation of keys in a secure way using the 
openpgp.js library.

Everything is run on the frontend, there is no interaction with the server, thus your keys and messages safely
stay on your machine. The source code is available for you to audit if you feel my word is not enough :)

Any contributions are happily welcomed
